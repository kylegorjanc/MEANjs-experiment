  <p><span class="first-sentence">It all started with a bet.</span> “If you can write content every day for a month,” I told my sister, “I’ll build it for you.” One month later, in January of 2012, I found myself learning HTML and CSS, figuring out how to set up hosting for a Wordpress site and stumbling through Photoshop and Illustrator trying to edit graphics.</p>

  <p>Over the next few years I took a backseat approach to Salty Running; most of my involvement consisted of writing occasional articles and helping to edit articles and photos. As we added more bloggers I became more and more involved in tech support and teaching bloggers the inner workings of Wordpress. Whenever I had some spare time I would perform software updates and tweak the site theme to look a little better. We grew and grew, the need for better content management became clear, and demands on my time became greater and greater. By 2015 it had become so much work Laura and I decided we had to either shut it down or get serious. </p>

  <p>Even though I had achieved some success at my lifelong dream of working as a camera assistant in the film industry, Salty Running had become more than just a blog, more than just a side project, it had become my passion. Not only had I forged friendships with women all over the world, I was becoming a better version of myself by spreading the message that women athletes don’t need or want to be reduced to fitness automatons in pursuit of a bikini body. Our little community blog was attracting 40k readers a month, and they believed in us too. We were making something meaningful, holding an industry accountable and having a lot of fun in the process. I knew I loved the kind of work I was doing and that I did not want to give up.</p>

  <p>I wasn’t sure how I could turn the work I was doing for Salty Running into a job, but I knew that if we were to continue with the site I would have to build a new site with an updated, mobile-friendly design and additional features. I took a huge chance, giving up months of lucrative film work and dove into an immersive web development bootcamp at General Assembly New York. There, I learned full stack JavaScript and Ruby on Rails and though I had a lot of fits and starts, I learned how to code web apps (like this one!), learned common practices of the development community and learned how to approach development problems. Although I walked away with coding skills, the most valuable thing I learned there was that I had a real passion for design and I loved the thrill of discovering what worked best for the people using the websites I built. </p>

  <p>Over the next year we focused first on the business development of Salty Running, and as we traveled to races for stories on the site, I fell in love with photography again and really stepped up my game in Photoshop, Illustrator and Sketch. I started working more closely with the writers who used our site and through them, became more engaged with the readership as well. And when my sister hired a business development consultant, I knew the answers to questions about who our readership was, what they looked for on our site and how they access the information. I had unwittingly created user profiles and stories, and suddenly I realized the part of Salty Running that I loved most was UX research.</p>

  <p>From there, I decided to take a UX/UI Design Fundamentals course through Bloc.io. My goal was to be able to transition as quickly as possible into a design career, and Bloc afforded me the opportunity to do my own work under the supervision of Amber Aultman, a designer from Jacksonville, FL who has worked for the Ignite agency and is currently working in house with the Tuft & Needle mattress company. Having her input and and enthusiastic support was a big difference in learning best practices, the importance of research, and most importantly my own weaknesses, those habits I really need to work hard at changing. </p>

  <p>Having recently completed my course with Bloc, I am now seeking full time work as a UX/UI Designer. I love creating experiences people love to use!</p>
